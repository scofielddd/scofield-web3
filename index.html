        <h2>🚀 introduction</h2>
        <p>
          I am a solutions-focused software developer proficient in C++, Python, JavaScript, C# (Unity), and Swift. Distinguished by my exemplary communication skills, aptitude for delving deep into problems, and unwavering passion for my work, I am on the hunt for a full-stack software development or game development position in Fall 2024.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2022, I engaged in computer graphics research, leveraging Qualisys to capture and refine full-body motion data. 
        </p>

        <p>
          By 2023, I transitioned to the HCI lab, where I designed an AR hand-tracking model via Mediapipe. Not stopping there, I integrated the Chat GPT API with Python and skillfully extracted key insights using POS tagging.
        </p>

        <p>
          A prime showcase of my innovative spirit is a gesture-driven car racing game, a culmination of Mediapipe and Unity's capabilities.

          Skill: ARKit · Mediapipe · spaCy · Unity
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Hand-Tracking Model Development:
             • Developed a hand-tracking model using MediapipeUnityPlugin and ARkit in Unity, harnessing iPhone’s LiDAR for precise 3D hand landmarking.
             • Crafted an AR mobile app for real-time virtual hand mesh overlay.
        </p>

        <p>
          2. NLP Program Development:
 • Prompt engineering to optimize GPT-generated textual responses.
 • Syntactic analysis of Chat-GPT outputs using part-of-speech tagging, utilizing packages like SpaCy.
